                <h3><i>Once upon a time, in a magical forest, lived a young girl named Lily. One day, she stumbled upon a sparkling, golden path. Curious, she followed it until she reached a beautiful crystal lake. There, she met a talking frog named Frodo. 

                    "Help me find the enchanted lily pad, and I will grant you a wish," said Frodo. Together, they searched high and low. Finally, under a glowing willow tree, they found the lily pad. 
                    
                    Frodo jumped on it, and with a flash of light, he transformed into a prince. "Thank you, Lily! You may now make a wish."
                    
                    Lily wished for the forest to be filled with laughter and joy forever. From that day on, the enchanted forest was a place where everyone who visited left with a heart full of happiness.</i></h3>

                <h3><i>In a kingdom where magic was ordinary, a kind-hearted unicorn named Stardust had a special gift: her horn could grant wishes. However, Stardust could only grant three wishes in her lifetime, and she had already used two.

                One day, she met a little boy named Timmy who was sad because his village's water well had dried up. Stardust decided to use her final wish to help. She touched the ground with her horn, and suddenly, a crystal-clear stream began to flow through the village, bringing life back to the crops and joy to the villagers.
                
                Timmy hugged Stardust, and she felt a warm glow in her heart. Though her wishing days were over, she knew she had made a difference. From then on, Timmy and the villagers took care of Stardust, ensuring she lived a happy and fulfilling life.</i></h3>

            <img src="dragon.jpg" alt="image">
            <p>
                <h3> <i>In a faraway land, a tiny dragon named Ember lived in a cozy cave on the edge of a small village. Ember was different from other dragons; instead of breathing fire, he breathed out warm, gentle breezes. 

                    The villagers were initially afraid of Ember, thinking he was dangerous. But one cold winter, when the village was buried under snow, Ember decided to help. He flew over the village, breathing out warm air to melt the snow and ice.
                    
                    The villagers were amazed and grateful. They welcomed Ember into their village, and he became their protector and friend. From then on, Ember's warm breezes helped grow crops in spring, cool the air in summer, and keep everyone cozy in winter.
                    
                    And so, Ember the friendly dragon lived happily among the villagers, proving that sometimes, being different is the most wonderful thing of all.</i></h3>
